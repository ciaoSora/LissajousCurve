# Lissajous Curve

## Introduction
What is Lissajous Curve? 

> In mathematics, a **Lissajous curve**, also known as **Lissajous figure** or **Bowditch curve**, is the graph of a system of parametric equations which describe complex harmonic motion. ----Wikipedia

For more infomation, see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve).

## What can this program do?
Draw the Lissajous curve corresponding to the given A1, ω1, A2, ω2, φ, where x = A1 * cos(ω1 * t + φ) and y = A2 * cos(ω2 * t).

Note that A1 and A2 are constant, and φ is changing automatically.

## Manual

- Use arrows or WASD to increase/decrease ω.
- Press space or click left button to pause/continue.
- Scroll the mouse wheel to speed up/down.

Enjoy :)
